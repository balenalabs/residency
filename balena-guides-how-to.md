# Balena Guides: How to

### Labs Residency v.1.1.0

We are currently in the process of building upon and improving [the existing labs residency.](https://jel.ly.fish/improvement-improve-completion-protocol-feedback-loops-residency-product-add87fc) Some of our key improvements are:

- Curating the [‘project pool’](https://github.com/balenalabs/balenalabs/projects/1) and making sure that the projects that are worked on during the residency are relevant to the mission of hub, labs and balena e.g. projects that showcase fleet capabilities that could translate to a commercial level. Consider balenaAir and how that could be utilised both on a personal basis and for a commercial audience e.g. hotels wanting to monitor the air quality in rooms and shared spaces.
- Improving guidelines on how to go through and complete (graduate) from the residency.
- Providing a clear off-boarding from labs into balena day to day.
- Providing an early opportunity to use balena tooling and processes in a low risk, low pressure setting.
- Gathering feedback from residents on completion in order to improve the residency and onboarding experiences.
- More support for both residents and guides in the way of labs hugs / syncs

*Note: At this stage, the following guidance is only relevant to engineering hires. We will be iterating on this for other skillsets shortly.*

As a guide, over the course of the four weeks your resident is completing their residency your responsibilities will include:

- **Help your resident choose a project from the [project pool,](https://github.com/balenalabs/balenalabs/projects/1)** or guide them to choose a project that follows the criteria of being fleet focused, relevant to the mission (as described above) and achievable to complete in four weeks.
- **Helping to guide your resident through the following checklist and timeline**
    
    The following checklist and timeline is purely for guidance, however we think it’ll be useful to have a clear set of steps and general milestones to complete in order to keep a better eye on the progress of the residency. It also makes it easier to pick up on any issues and provide help. Of course some of these may vary depending on the project which is completely expected - it’s mainly the setup and graduation that is more rigid. We intend to have a channel in JF going forward to keep the progress of residents up to date, but in the iterim we will be using the [Resident Progress Project Board in the residency repo on github]([https://github.com/orgs/balenalabs/projects/2/views/1?layout=board](https://github.com/orgs/balenalabs/projects/2/views/1?layout=board))
    
    - **Setup dev environment / review documentation / masterclasses (week 1)** - this should be completed by the first week of the residency, and we hope that some of this will have been done as part of the first onboarding week at balena pre residency
    - **Project outline and scope, vetted by HHR (by end of week 2)** - as above, an appropriate project needs to have been chosen ideally by the end of week 2.
    - **Ordering parts (weeks 1-3)**
    - **Hardware setup (weeks 2-3)**
    - **Software setup (weeks 2-3)**
    - **Initial demo to the labs hug / or to you, their guide (week 4)**
    - **Blog post (week 4)** - the first draft of the blog post about their residency project should be finished by the end of week 4. Proofreading and publish to the website will likely take over the four week period and that’s fine.
    - **Open fleet (week 4)**
    - **Graduation (end of week 4)**
- **Attend labs hugs with your resident.** We are reintroducing the labs hug sessions as we’ve noticed doing the residency can be isolating for residents, and also provides more pressure onto the shoulders of guides. This improves the peer group and provides a natural working group. The hug should be the opportunity for residents to share updates with each other, ask questions. etc The rest of the team are also welcome to attend these sessions to help give advice / feedback.
- **Encourage your resident to submit updates about their project to the all hands call.** This is another opportunity to the residents to sync with the rest of the team and gain advice or input. It also familiarises them with the process of updating the rest of the team on what they’re working on and working in the open.
- **Gather any feedback from your resident on the process / encourage them to provide feedback about tooling, the residency. etc.** This can be done in the way of patterns, encouraging them to share in Jellyfish and the survey at the end of their residency. Equally provide feedback on how it was being a guide! We’ll have a survey for you too.

How much time you dedicate is completely up to you, some residents may need more help than others - but we anticipate it can be anywhere from two hours (including one hour for the labs hug) a week upwards. If at any point you need additional support , please reach out to the labs team so we can help. 

Please also make sure you submit your guiding hours to the [teamwork model (residency guide records tab)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsQjoMqQaw2Xv_Dk6UobmsBSnNJy2cGuKE57C2qIo2s/edit#gid=159464637), so it can be accounted for in relation to support hours and other responsibilities.
